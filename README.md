# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship
This repository contains the files for my KPMG Data Analytics Consulting Virtual Internship. They are solutions to the tasks given to me as a data analyst consulting.
The tasks involve three stages as highlighted below. 
Task one - Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis.  The task involve identifying data quality issues and strategies to mitigate the issues. 
Task Two - Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes. The assignment was to develop a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the approach in targeting new customers.
Task Three - Using visualisations to present insights. I created a dashboard for the client that specifies who they should be targeting in their customer list as well as the broader market segment.
